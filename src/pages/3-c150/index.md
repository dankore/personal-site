## Overview

Unlike [the alumni website I created for GSS Gwarinpa class of 2006](https://gosan06.netlify.com/), I created this website for the both present and past GSS Gwarinpa students to network. GSS Gwarinpa, my alma mater, has no website of its own.

## Tech stack

- JavaScript
- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB Cloud
- Authentication
- HTLM5
- Boostrap4
- MVC architecture
