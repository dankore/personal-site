## Overview

This is a project which idea was born of a visit to an elementary school. I went from hosting the site in a static WordPress template and utilizing Google Forms to collect and store data to partnering with a professional web developer to rebirth the idea in a more robust web development environment.

The site is currently averaging more than 4,000 unique visits and 400,000 requests a month*.

I write code in Hyperapp and style in TailwindCSS which run in a Docker Swam cluster. I also do content addition
and SEO.

I also lead a small marketing team which comprised of volunteer content creators. We also help small business owners get their businesses on the site to increase sales.

The mission of the project is to help people live abroad with success and encourgae cross-cultural interaction in a fun, creative, and interactive way.
