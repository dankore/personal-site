## Overview

This is a project which idea was born of a visit to an elementary school. I went from hosting the site in a static WordPress template and utilizing Google Forms to collect and store data to partnering with a professional web developer to rebirth the idea in a more robust web development environment.

The site is currently avereging more than 4,000 unique visits and 500,000 requests a month.

I made several of the site's static pages, content addition, and SEO.

I lead the marketing team which comprised of volunteer content creators and those helping small business onwers get their presence online.

The mission of the project is to help people live abroad with success and encourgae cross-cultural interaction a in fun, creative, and interactive way.
